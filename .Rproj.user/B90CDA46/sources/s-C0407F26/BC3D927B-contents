I am a PhD. student in Agricultural & Resource Economics at [Resource Economics & Environmental Sociology](https://www.ualberta.ca/resource-economics-environmental-sociology/) at University of Alberta. 

My research aims to better understand decision making involving environmental resources, and to use this understanding to improve natural resource management. I typically use a microeconomics framework and applied econometric methods to model human behavior, test hypotheses, and develop policy recommendations.

My current research focuses on recreationistsâ€™ non-market behavior and the use of incentives to increase public good contributions. My current research primarily includes:
- Examining recreationist' spatial and temporal behavioral responses to external factors (e.g. wildlife disease) and resource management programs by developing a recreation demand model with revealed and stated preference data. 
- Identifying people's motivations and evaluating different incentive programs to increase the contribution to impure public goods with data collected from lab and framed field experiments.
- Developing methods to improve the incentive compatibility of responses to contingent behavior (CB) questions in stated preference tasks with data collected from lab experiments.
