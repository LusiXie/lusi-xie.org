abstract: Individuals make decisions on location choices and timing of activities in response to changes in environmental conditions and incentives. Examples include restaurant choices, livelihood choices and recreational/holiday choices. In economic decision-making, economists focus mostly on location instead of time, thus the behavioral and welfare impacts of the incentives associated with temporal dimensions of choice are largely unknown. We develop a flexible econometric model that combines spatial and temporal choices at intensive and extensive margins to assess individualsâ€™ behavioral responses to incentives that offer time flexibility. We estimate the model using data on recreational hunting trips in Alberta, Canada to examine how individuals respond to the incentive of a longer recreation season. We find that individuals substitute activities spatially and temporally, and gain welfare benefits when there is increased flexibility in choosing the time of the activities. Our findings suggest time flexibility could be used as an incentive to change behavior when decisions involve time.
