I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia.

I am an environmental economist with expertise in environmental valuation and experimental economics. My interdisciplinary research applies economic tools to address environmental issues by providing a better understanding of human behavior and informing policy design. 

My topics of specialization include wildlife conservation, water resource management, and agri-environmental policies. My research makes methodological contributions by developing novel recreation demand models, advancing the design of stated preference surveys, comparing behavioral responses from students and stakeholders in economic experiments, and connecting laboratory with field experiments to inform program implementation. 

Feel free to contact me at [lusi.xie@uga.edu](mailto:lusi.xie@uga.edu)
